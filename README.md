The open source community is diverse and highly motivated. We're sure you'll be able to find someone who can help you (or that you can help) no matter what your interests are.

Whether it's development or advocacy, open source software and other collaborative projects benefit through, and because of, community. Unlike traditional projects that require physical resources, sharing economies are generally only hindered by the number of people contributing to an effort and their ability to acquire and share knowledge.

Our development efforts generate resources for collaborative organizations, to help create and maintain communication within and among open source projects; motivate and efficiently organize groups of remote individuals, and; cultivate an open ethos where the principles and practices of open source can foster collaboration co-creation and community.
