The open source community is diverse and highly motivated. We're sure you'll be able to find someone who can help you (or that you can help) no matter what your interests are.

Unlike traditional projects that require physical resources, sharing economies are generally only hindered by the number of people contributing to an effort and their ability to acquire and share knowledge.
